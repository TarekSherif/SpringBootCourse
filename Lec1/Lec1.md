## Part One: Introduction to Java Spring Boot (45 minutes)

### 1. Introduction to Java and Spring Framework

- **Java as a Programming Language:**
  - **History of Java:** Developed in the 1990s by Sun Microsystems. It is an object-oriented programming language widely used in application development.
  - **Java Features:** 
    - Portability (Write Once, Run Anywhere).
    - Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection).
    - Support for multithreading.

- **Spring Framework:**
  - **What is Spring?** An open-source framework for Java application development. Provides features like Dependency Injection and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
  - **Importance of Spring:** Helps developers build flexible and scalable applications.

### 2. What is Spring Boot?

- **Definition of Spring Boot:**
  - A framework built on Spring aimed at simplifying the application development process. Provides default settings and reduces the need for complex configurations.

- **Benefits of Using Spring Boot:**
  - Accelerates development: Default settings make getting started faster.
  - Automatic configuration: Spring Boot configures the application based on existing libraries.
  - Embedded web server: The application can run as a standalone service without an external server.

## Part Two: Setting Up the Development Environment (45 minutes)

### 1. Required Tools

- **Installing JDK:**
  - The Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed on the system. It can be downloaded from Oracle's or OpenJDK's website.

- **Setting Up IDE:**
  - **IntelliJ IDEA:** One of the best IDEs for Java. The free Community Edition can be downloaded.
  - **Eclipse:** Another popular option, available from the official Eclipse website.

### 2. Creating a Spring Boot Project

- **Using Spring Initializr:**
  - Visit [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
  - Choose project type (Maven or Gradle).
  - Specify programming language (Java).
  - Select Spring Boot version.
  - Add necessary dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, Spring Data JPA).
  - Click "Generate" to download the project.

- **Explaining the Structure of the Resulting Project:**
  - `src/main/java`: Contains the application code.
  - `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files.
  - `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`: Contains dependency information.

## Part Five: Q&A Session (30 minutes)

- **Open the Floor for Questions:**
  - Invite students to ask questions about the topics covered.

- **Discussion of Topics:**
  - Discuss practical applications of Spring Boot.
  - Exchange ideas on how to use Spring Boot in real projects.

This way, you have prepared a comprehensive lecture covering the basics and helping students get started with Java Spring Boot. You can adjust the content based on the students' needs and level of knowledge.
